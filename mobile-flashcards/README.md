This is a Flashcards app that allows you to:
- Create a new deck
- Add Questions and Answers as a flashcard to the deck
- View the decks of flashcards you have created
- Take a quiz on a deck that will show you how many you got correct

#### `npm install`

This will install all of the project's dependencies from npm

#### `expo start`

Runs the app in the development mode using [expo.io](https://expo.io/).<br />
Once expo is running you can choose to run the app in the web browser or on your phone. This app was built with Android in mind so I may not work or be visually appealing in iOS.
